# About

This repository contains a set of utility scripts centered around the Bambu Lab's 3D printer ecosystem.

The most important directories are:

1. `RFID_dump_decoder`, which provides a helper script for decoding the RFID tags on Bambu Lab's filament.

2. `ipcam_directory_organizer`, which provides a helper script for organizing the videos that the Bambu Labs print chamber cameras.

3. `build_plate_markers`, which provides scripts for generating and detecting build plate marker images, as well as the build plate markers by themselves.

Each directory has its own README.md with mre info.

Lastly, there is a `docs` folder that contains general documentation about Bambu Lab devices and the ecosystem.
