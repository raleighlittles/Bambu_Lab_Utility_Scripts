# About

This repository contains a set of utility scripts centered around the Bambu Labs 3D printer ecosystem.

The two most important directories are:

1. `RFID_dump_decoder`, which provides a helper script for decoding the RFID tags on Bambu Lab's filament.

2. `ipcam_directory_organizer` which provides a helper script for organizing the videos that the Bambu Labs print chamber cameras.

Each directory has its own README.md with mre info.

Lastly, there is a `docs` folder that contains general documentation about Bambu Labs devices and the ecosystem.
