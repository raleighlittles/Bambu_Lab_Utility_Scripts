# Apple Icon Image Format (*.icns)

The icns are a bit of a special case. I recommend reading the wikipedia article on them: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Icon_Image_format

Since they're not viewable by most standard OS-included image viewers, I created a converter (in `icns_converter`) that uses [rust-icns](https://github.com/mdsteele/rust-icns)  to convert those icns into viewable images (PNGs).

For more information, see the README.md in the `icns` folder.
